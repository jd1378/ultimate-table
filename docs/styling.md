# Styling

Styling of the table is different from project to project. hence, it is upon you to style it as you see fit.

This project provides you with a base styling and two variants which aim to ease your styling. I recommend to copy the files you need and customize them based on your needs.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: To ensure you get consistent borders with the bordered version, make sure your columns are grouped only in even numbers.

To use base style with each of the variants you can import them:

```ts
import "vue-grid-table/styles/base.css";

import "vue-grid-table/styles/basic.bordered.css";
// or 
import "vue-grid-table/styles/basic.borderless.css";
```

You can find the source for these files here:
